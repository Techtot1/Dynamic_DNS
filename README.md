# Dynamic_DNS
This project was built to use AWS's route53 with a dynamic ip and keep it from breaking.
## How to use
Enter API keys and hosted zone in [Config.json](https://github.com/Techtot1/Dynamic_DNS/blob/main/Config.json)
and setup cronjob for [Get_ip.py](https://github.com/Techtot1/Dynamic_DNS/blob/main/Get_ip.py) or use [call.py](https://github.com/Techtot1/Dynamic_DNS/blob/main/Call.py) if you don't like cron. (don't use this.)
